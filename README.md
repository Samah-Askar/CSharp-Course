# CSharp-Course


## ðŸ“˜ About the Course

This course gave me a solid foundation in:
- Object-Oriented Programming (encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces)
- C# syntax and conventions
- Working with classes, methods, parameters, and operator overloading
- Building full-stack web apps using ASP.NET MVC
- Entity Framework and SQL Server integration

## ðŸ›  Key Projects

- **Car Insurance Quote Web App**  
  An MVC application that calculates insurance quotes based on user input and business logic. Includes form handling, validation, CRUD operations, and database integration.


## ðŸš€ What's Next

I plan to continue building robust C# applications â€” from backend APIs to Unity-based games. This is just the beginning.
